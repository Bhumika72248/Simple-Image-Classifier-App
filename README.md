# Simple Image Classifier App

This repository contains a simple, yet powerful, web application for classifying images.  
Built with **Python**, it leverages the **Streamlit** framework to create an interactive user interface and the **Hugging Face Transformers** library to perform image classification using a state-of-the-art pre-trained model.

The app allows users to upload an image and instantly see a list of predicted labels with their corresponding confidence scores.
