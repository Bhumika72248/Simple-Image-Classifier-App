# Simple-Image-Classifier-App
A minimalist web application built with Streamlit that classifies images. Users can upload an image, and the app leverages a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from the Hugging Face transformers library to predict its contents. This project serves as a simple, end-to-end demonstration of deploying a machine learning model as a web service

#instructions
1. Install dependencies:
#    pip install streamlit transformers torch Pillow
 2. Run the app:
#    streamlit run app.py
